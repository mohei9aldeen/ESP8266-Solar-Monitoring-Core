ESP8266 Solar & Battery Monitoring System Overview
=================

This project demonstrates a structured firmware architecture for a commercial-grade solar and battery monitoring system built using ESP8266.

The system is designed for long-term stability in off-grid environments and includes power monitoring, web-based data visualization, and multi-device I2C management.

 Key Features :
 =================
* Real-time solar & battery status monitoring

* Embedded web server with XML endpoints

* Software watchdog implementation

* Structured EEPROM configuration storage

* I2C device handling (RTC + LCD)

* Modular firmware architecture

* Defensive programming approach for reliability


 Architecture Highlights :
 =================

* Non-blocking design principles

* Hang detection & recovery logic

* Clean separation of hardware initialization

* Lightweight web API for remote monitoring
