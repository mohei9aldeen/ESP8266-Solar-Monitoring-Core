ESP8266 Solar & Battery Monitoring System Overview

This project demonstrates a structured firmware architecture for a commercial-grade solar and battery monitoring system built using ESP8266.

The system is designed for long-term stability in off-grid environments and includes power monitoring, web-based data visualization, and multi-device I2C management.
